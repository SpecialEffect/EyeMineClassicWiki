# README

This repo is an empty repo to store a backup of the full (legacy) documentation for the original version of EyeMine (now named EyeMine Classic).

You can get to the documentation by going to the [wiki](https://github.com/kmcnaught/EyeMineClassicWiki/wiki)

The full EyeMine code still can be found at https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine/ on the appropriate branch, but the wiki there will refer to EyeMineV2.
